In this notebook, we will predict the score based on hours they are reading. Te process we will follow is this:<br>
<br>
1) Import important libraries such as pandas, numpy for mathematical approach and for data visualization we will import libraries as matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.<br>
2) Then we will read the data from given link https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://bit.ly/w-data&ust=1602310440000000&usg=AOvVaw3dWIh4sNbW684d5Jgkbhxl&hl=en.<br>
3) After that we will get the statistics of the data and find if there are any null values in the data.<br>
4) Now we will visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn for finding any outliers if there is any.<br>
5) Using scatter plot we will visualize the relation between hours and scores.<br>
For training purpose we have taken two different approach here:<br>
<center>1) Without using inbuilt functions and libraries<br>
2) Using in-built functions and libraries<br></center>
<br>
The model 1 approach is as following:<br>
