# Predicting-Score-based-on-Hours-by-using-Supervised-ML

In this notebook, we will predict the score based on hours they are reading. Te process we will follow is this:

1) Import important libraries such as pandas, numpy for mathematical approach and for data visualization we will import libraries as matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

2) Then we will read the data from given link [link text itself]:http://bit.ly/w-data

3) After that we will get the statistics of the data and find if there are any null values in the data.

4) Now we will visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn for finding any outliers if there is any.

5) Using scatter plot we will visualize the relation between hours and scores.

For training purpose we have taken two different approach here:

1) Without using inbuilt functions and libraries
2) Using in-built functions and libraries
